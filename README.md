# Machine Learning Course on BTK Akademi

This repository contains exercises and materials from the BTK Akademi Machine Learning Course. In addition I have complete 2 project: Classification Project: [Airline Passenger Satisfaction
](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) and Regression Project: [Urban Air Quality and Health Impact Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullah0a/urban-air-quality-and-health-impact-dataset). I obtained dataset from Kaggle. Below, you will find details about the courses, as well as links to the course materials and certifications.

## Classification Project : Airline Passenger Satisfaction

### Overview

This project focuses on classifying categorical data using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC).
### Model Evaluation
#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

	weighted avg   0.93      0.93      0.93     25976

### Conclusion

The model achieved strong performance with a 90% accuracy. Further enhancements may include hyperparameter tuning or experimenting with alternative classification algorithms.

## Regression Project : Urban Air Quality and Health Impact Analysis

### Overview

This project involves predicting continuous target variables using Lineer Regression, Polinomial Regressior, Decision Tree Regressor, KNN Regressor, Random Forest Regressior models.
